# SIMDe Without Test Cases

This repository contains only the core of
[SIMDe](https://github.com/nemequ/simde).  It is generated
automatically for every commit to master, and is intended to be used
as a submodule in projects which don't want to include the (rather
large) test cases.

All development work happens in the main repository, please do not
file issues or create pull requests against this repository.
